# S3-Simple-Storage-Service
This project shows my hands-on experience with Amazon S3, IAM, S3 Versioning, public hosting, and AWS KMS encryption. I deployed a static HTML/CSS To-Do app using S3 to demonstrate secure, scalable cloud storage, encryption, access control, and real-world static website hosting skills.
